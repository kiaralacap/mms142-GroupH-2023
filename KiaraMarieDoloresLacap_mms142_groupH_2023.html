<h1>Definition</h1>
<p>Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is a process that builds three-dimensional objects through layer-by-layer construction from a computer-aided design (CAD). (What Is 3D Printing? - Technology Definition and Types, n.d.)</p>

<p>These days, 3D printing is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. The field of 3D printing technology is rapidly developing. The fields of agriculture, healthcare, automotive, locomotives, and aviation are among those that are using 3D printing technology more and more for mass customisation and the production of open-source designs.
