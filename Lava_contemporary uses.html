        <h3>Contemporary Uses</h3>
        <p align="justify">The use of 3D printing technology helps speed up the production and modification of 3D prototypes of the designers and manufacturers from various industries. This includes but not limited to the following:</p>
	<ul type="disk">
		<li><h4>Agriculture.</h4>
		<p align="justify">Developing parts of farming tools, irrigation and waste management equipment, urban gardening tools. Some examples are thermoplastic materials found in sprinklers and hose splitters, spare machine parts from corn auger, gears of seed sowing equipment, fruit picker, shovel handle, packer bottom, and spigot.</p>
		<li><h4>Environment Sustainability.</h4>
	    	<p align="justify">Some examples are 3D model testing instruments for environmental conservation such as air quality monitors, filters, membranes, separation devices for water treatment, microbial fuel cells, solar cells, and wind turbines.</p>
		<li><h4>Healthcare.</h4>
	    	<p align="justify">Customization of prosthetics such as hearing aids, arm and leg prosthetics, denture models, and bone grafts as well as replication of body organs models and structures for learning purposes.</p>
		<li><h4>Automotive and Aviation.</h4>
	    	<p align="justify">Carbon-fiber and metal materials are extensively used by engineers to shape and manufacture unibody frames, fuselage, powertrain designs, and other components and assemblies. Sometimes, they replace metal with more carbon-fiber since it's lighter.</p>
		<li><h4>Arts and Design.</h4>
	    	<p align="justify">Wax castings and resin in jewelry, chairs, and tables. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic in toys, board games, toolboxes, office supplies organizers, furniture pieces, architecture 3D prototypes, sculptures, and parts of musical instruments. Flexible filaments to construct clothing, accessories, and shoe designs.</p>
		<li><h4>Household.</h4>
	    	<p align="justify">Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) plastics in plumbing fittings in faucets and sinks,  and kitchenware such as knife holders, baked goods molder, towel racks, disposable cutlery, appliance and electronics parts such as mechanical spare parts, knobs, grips, outer covering, and feet of the appliances and many more.</p>
