        <h2>How 3D Printing is a Disruptive Technology</h2>

        <h3>What is Disruptive Technology?</h3>
        <p>Disruptive technology is a new technology that may not be as polished at first compared to the existing technologies but still has the potential to be fully developed.</p>
        <p>Not all cases of disruptive technologies are harmful. The term “disruptive” in disruptive technology isn’t always a bad thing as it opens a lot of opportunities for different sectors at a lower and more accessible cost. Just like in the industry of 3D Printing, it does not exactly disrupt existing technologies but it raises the competition (Rayna and Striukova, 2015).</p>

        <h3>Innovation of Materials (Accessible and Affordable Manufacturing) (Terelle)</h3>
        <p>One of the most accessible and affordable materials that can be used in 3D Printing is food. Made by a team of engineers in Columbia University, cheesecake was made through 3D printing using only 7 food ingredients such as graham crackers liquified as paste, peanut butter, strawberry jam, Nutella, banana purée, cherry juice, and frosting. These 7 ingredients were used as “inks” to print one serving of cheesecake. They used a modified 3D printer called Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) which is a device that uses lasers to thermally process the ingredients in order for its output to be stable and have a proper texture and structure.</p>
        <p>The engineers believe that patients with special medical needs and dietary restrictions will benefit from this 3D Printing innovation.</p>
