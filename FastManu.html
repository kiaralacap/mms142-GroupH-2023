    <h1>Faster and Cheaper Manufacturing</h1>
    <p>3D Printing lessens the cost of time and even materials due to having simpler processes compared to using other machines. Furthermore, all the manual labor involved is now replaced into digital; using computer and softwares to create models, which is perfect for faster prototyping. All it takes is utilizing the CAD (Computer-Aided Design) data which is much more accessible and flexible. An example of how less time it takes is when manufacturers need to create a different variation of a product, all they have to do is to make alterations in the CAD data. As King (2023) states, “3D printing is the common term for additive manufacturing, which means adding raw materials layer by layer.” This indicates that 3D printing also is not wasteful when it comes to using raw materials. It only produces the exact amount of printed material needed, and there would be no excess.
