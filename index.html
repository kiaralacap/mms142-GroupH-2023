    <h2>3D Printing as Disruptive Technology</h2>

    <h3>I. Introduction to 3D Printing</h3>
    <h4>A. Definition</h4>
    <p>Additive manufacturing, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is a process that builds three-dimensional objects through layer-by-layer construction from a computer-aided design (CAD). These days, 3D printing is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, with applications in agriculture, healthcare, automotive, locomotives, and aviation.</p>

	<p>B. History

In the 1980s, there were significant people that revolutionized the concept of 3D printing. In 1981, Hideo Kodama used incremental photosensitive resin polymerized by UV light to create samples of manufactured products, which was later used as a foundation in today’s Stereolithography (SLA) machines. In that same year, Charles Hull created 3D models of custom parts by the same method (photosensitive resin which was cured layer by layer). Unlike Kodama, Hull was able to successfully patent his work in 1988, making the SLA-1 the first commercial SLA 3D printer. This also led to the development of 3D Systems Corporation in 1988. 

Often termed as additive fabrication, 3D Printing was evident in other methods, such as that of the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) founded and patented by Carl Deckard in 1988. This method fused powders through laser technique. Another process was the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication by Scott Crump, where filaments were expelled from a heated nozzle.

The 90s to the early 2000s were considered to be an era of growth, in the sense that more and more of the industry has adapted to such printing methods, largely for prototyping and inventing. A great example would be the RepRap Project by Adrian Bowyer in 2005, where the 3D printer could print another functioning 3D printer. Another would be the creation of the first prosthetics, which was a revolutionary time for medicine. The transition to the 2010s was centered on making 3D Printing more cost-effective and available. Carbon Fiber and Glass Fiber from merely printing in 3D. In recent times, 3D Printing has been catered to making life more efficient, with examples such as hearing aids and even fully functional buildings.

3D Printing continues to be innovated and changed.</p>


<h2>C. Contemporary Uses</h2>

<p>The use of 3D printing technology helps speed up the production and modification of 3D prototypes of the designers and manufacturers from various industries. This includes but is not limited to the following:</p>

<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>3D printing has its uses in agriculture through developing parts of farming tools such as irrigation and waste management equipment, and urban gardening tools. Some examples include thermoplastic materials found in sprinklers and hose splitters, gears of seed sowing equipment, fruit picker, shovel handle, and spigot.</p>

<h3>Environment Sustainability</h3>
<p>In the realm of environmental conservation, 3D modeling is making waves. Engineers are developing air quality monitors, filters, and water treatment devices using this new technology. To name a few, microbial fuel cells, solar cells, and wind turbines are now crafted with precision due to 3D printing.</p>

<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>In healthcare, 3D printing helps bring personalization to a whole new level. Prosthetics like hearing aids, arm and leg prosthetics, and denture models are being tailor-made and specific to patients. Recent developments in 3D printing have also resulted in replicating body organ models for educational purposes, and even creating bone grafts that fit a person perfectly.</p>

<h3>Automotive and Aviation</h3>
<p>Engineers in the automotive and aviation industries are reshaping the industry through 3D printing. They're using carbon-fiber and metal materials to craft unibody frames, fuselages, powertrain designs, and various other components. The materials serve as lighter carbon-fiber alternatives to traditional metals.</p>

<h3>Arts and Design</h3>
<p>Creativity knows no bounds with 3D printing in the arts and design world. A lot of the fame that 3D printing gets is through its more artistic uses, specifically in cosplay and figurines. Wax castings and resin are used in creating costumes, jewelry, and even furniture to life. ABS plastic is finding its way into toys, board games, architecture prototypes, and even parts of musical instruments. Flexible filaments are also making waves in the fashion world, creating clothing, accessories, and shoe designs that are a perfect fit for style enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Household</h3>
<p>In our homes, 3D printing is becoming part of everyday life. PVC plastics are shaping plumbing fittings, faucets, sinks, and even something as simple as kitchenware like knife holders and towel racks. From disposable cutlery to mechanical spare parts for appliances, 3D printing is leaving its mark in every nook and cranny of our households. It's not just about practicality; it's about adding that touch of innovation to the things we use every day.</p>


    <h3>II. How 3D Printing is a Disruptive Technology</h3>
    
    <h4>A. What is Disruptive Technology and why is it not necessarily a bad thing?</h4>
    <p>Disruptive technologies significantly alter established industries, business models, or consumer habits. Despite the term "disruptive," this isn't necessarily bad. 3D printing, for instance, opens opportunities for different sectors at a lower and more accessible cost.</p>


    <h3>B. Innovation of Materials (Accessible and affordable manufacturing)</h3>
    <p>One of the most accessible and affordable materials used in 3D printing is food. Cheesecake, for example, has been made using a modified Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer, offering benefits specifically for patients with special medical needs and dietary restrictions.</p>


    <h3>C. Faster and Cheaper Manufacturing</h3>
    <p>3D printing reduces the cost of time and materials due to simpler processes. It utilizes Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data for faster prototyping and minimizes waste by producing only the exact amount of material needed. </p>



    <h3>D. Decentralized / Democratizing Manufacturing</h3>
    <p>Traditional manufacturing involves centralized facilities, while 3D printing allows for decentralized manufacturing. Products can be produced on-site or closer to the point of use, reducing supply chain needs and lowering transportation costs.</p>


    <h3>E. Customization and Personalization</h3>
    <p>3D printing enables the creation of customized and personalized products on a large scale, disrupting traditional mass production methods and benefiting industries like healthcare, fashion, and leisure.</p>
