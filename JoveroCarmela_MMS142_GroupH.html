    <h1>History of 3D Printing</h1>
    <p>In the 1980s, there were significant people that revolutionized the concept of 3D printing. In 1981, Hideo Kodama used incremental photosensitive resin polymerized by UV light to create samples of manufactured products, which was later used as a foundation in todayâ€™s Stereolithography (SLA) machines. In that same year, Charles Hull created 3D models of custom parts by the same method (photosensitive resin which was cured layer by layer). Unlike Kodama, Hull was able to successfully patent his work in 1988, making the SLA-1 the first commercial SLA 3D printer. This also led to the development of 3D Systems Corporation in 1988. <br>

        Often termed as additive fabrication, 3D Printing was evident in other methods, such as that of the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) founded and patented by Carl Deckard in 1988. This method fused powders through laser technique. Another process was the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication by Scott Crump, where filaments were expelled from a heated nozzle. <br>

        The 90s to the early 2000s were considered to be an era of growth, in the sense that more and more of the industry has adapted to such printing methods, largely for prototyping and inventing. A great example would be the RepRap Project by Adrian Bowyer in 2005, where the 3D printer could print another functioning 3D printer. Another would be the creation of the first prosthetics, which was a revolutionary time for medicine. The transition to the 2010s was centered on making 3D Printing more cost-effective and available. Carbon Fiber and Glass Fiber from merely printing in 3D. In recent times, 3D Printing has been catered to making life more efficient, with examples such as hearing aids and even fully functional buildings.<br>

        3D Printing continues to be innovated and changed.
